# ECF4J: A tool based on Soot for generating ECFG for Java

## Introduce
The project is based on [Soot](https://github.com/Sable/soot), and is used to generate ECFG graph for Java. The graph generated by this tool should feed into [Preparation](https://github.com/zzhzz/MFGNNPreparation) firstly.

## Usage
- The `jar` packages of PROMISE dataset are stored in a zip file, [Download](https://disk.pku.edu.cn:443/link/CC0B3F4EA2733E27510D744563626349) and unzip directly.
- Download the project via `git clone https://github.com/zzhzz/ECFG4J`
- Build the project via `mvn package`
- The binary release of the project is under `target` directory, named as `ECFG4J-with-dependencies.jar`
- Specific the class name and directories through command line (e.g. `java -jar ECFG4J-with-dependencies.jar datas projects/ant-1.5/lib org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.War`)
